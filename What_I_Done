For Making this Simple Projet i use  a first Making this like a Board but than facing it's all parts like Soldering and all things i use than the Breadboard.


2. Robotics Car :-

-For making an this car first of all we make a One Group of My friend and We Think like similarly Like We have to do something So we Make this Using Some Fundamentals , Some Used an AI Also Use a Better Advice From the Professors also.
For making this Help and giving that Idea Is the 2 Professors :- Dr. Ravi kant and,
                                                                 Dr. Ankur Changela. 

-Than we Buy required Products and step by step implementing those and some fundamentals also Build . We know like a Where to give a power supply than where to connect the Inputs And the How to actuating the Gearmotors Using the Bluettoth Controller , Ultrasonic Sensor , And Manually also.
We first us the L298d but we don't know but it's than not working so we Use the L293D and succesfully Do connections but at every Stage we Face the Challanges and we Step by step done it by many efforts.
